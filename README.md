### ⚕️Caffeine -> Theobromine
This is a guide on how to convert caffeine into theobromine, including the amounts of different reagents to add and adjustments for varying amounts of caffeine:

**🧱Materials:**

* Caffeine (variable amount)
* Methanol (1 mL per 100 mg of caffeine)
* Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) (0.5 g per 100 mg of caffeine)
* Dimethyl sulfate (CH3OSO3CH3) (0.05 mL per 100 mg of caffeine)
* Distilled water (25 mL per 100 mg of caffeine)
* Ethyl acetate (25 mL per 100 mg of caffeine)
* Sodium chloride (NaCl) (0.5 g per 100 mg of caffeine)
* Separatory funnel
* Filter paper
* Rotary evaporator

**✅Procedure:**

1. **Preparation of the caffeine-base complex:**

   a. Dissolve the desired amount of caffeine in methanol (1 mL per 100 mg of caffeine) in a round-bottom flask.

   b. Add 0.5 g of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) per 100 mg of caffeine to the solution.

   c. Stir the mixture for 5 minutes per 100 mg of caffeine to ensure complete deprotonation of caffeine.

2. **Addition of the methylating agent:**

   a. Carefully add 0.05 mL of dimethyl sulfate (CH3OSO3CH3) per 100 mg of caffeine to the caffeine-base solution using a pipette.

   b. Stir the reaction mixture for 1 hour at room temperature to allow the methylation reaction to proceed.

3. **Quenching the reaction:**

   a. Slowly add 25 mL of distilled water per 100 mg of caffeine to the reaction mixture to quench the reaction and stop further methylation.

4. **Extraction of theobromine:**

   a. Transfer the quenched reaction mixture to a separatory funnel.

   b. Add 25 mL of ethyl acetate per 100 mg of caffeine to the separatory funnel.

   c. Shake the separatory funnel vigorously for 3 minutes to allow the theobromine to partition into the ethyl acetate layer.

   d. Let the layers separate, and carefully transfer the bottom layer containing the ethyl acetate to a clean round-bottom flask.

   e. Repeat the extraction step two more times to ensure complete extraction of theobromine.

5. **Purification of theobromine:**

   a. Combine the ethyl acetate extracts from step 4 in a round-bottom flask.

   b. Add 0.5 g of sodium chloride (NaCl) per 100 mg of caffeine to the flask to remove any remaining water from the ethyl acetate layer.

   c. Shake the mixture gently for a few minutes to allow the sodium chloride to absorb the water.

   d. Filter the mixture through filter paper to remove the sodium chloride and any solid impurities.

6. **Isolation of theobromine:**

   a. Use a rotary evaporator to remove the ethyl acetate solvent from the filtrate obtained in step 5.

   b. The remaining residue will contain the purified theobromine.

**🔢Theoretical yield:**

The theoretical yield of theobromine from this procedure is approximately 1.1 g per 100 mg of caffeine. However, the actual yield may be lower due to losses during the extraction and purification steps.

**😷Safety precautions:**

* Dimethyl sulfate is a toxic and corrosive compound. Handle it with care and wear appropriate protective gloves and goggles.

* The reaction should be carried out in a well-ventilated area to prevent inhalation of harmful fumes.

* All waste materials should be disposed of properly according to local regulations.

**🛠️Adjustments for varying amounts of caffeine:**

The amounts of reagents and solvents mentioned in the procedure can be adjusted proportionally based on the amount of caffeine you have. For instance, if you have 200 mg of caffeine, you would use 2 mL of methanol, 1 g of sodium hydroxide, 0.1 mL of dimethyl sulfate, 50 mL of distilled water, and 50 mL of ethyl acetate.

Remember to scale up or down the amounts of all reagents and solvents proportionally to ensure the correct stoichiometry and efficient conversion of caffeine to theobromine.

### Procedure for separating xylometazoline from ipratropium bromide:

1. **Extract ipratropium bromide with DCM:**

   a. Pour 10ml of **Otrivin Comp** into a clean separatory funnel (**5mg xylometazoline, 6mg ipratropium bromide**)

   b. Add 10ml of distilled water to the separatory funnel.

   c. Add 5ml of DCM to the separatory funnel.

   d. Shake the separatory funnel gently for about a minute.

   e. Allow the layers to separate. The bottom layer will contain the DCM extract, which contains the ipratropium bromide.

   f. Carefully transfer the DCM extract to a clean vial.

   g. Repeat steps b to f two more times to ensure complete extraction of ipratropium bromide.

2. **Discard the aqueous layer containing xylometazoline:**

   a. Carefully pour the aqueous layer containing xylometazoline down the drain.

   b. Rinse the separatory funnel with water to remove any remaining traces of xylometazoline.

3. **Proceed with the synthesis of atropine from the DCM extract:**

   a. Continue with the dequaternization and Hofmann elimination steps as described earlier to convert the extracted ipratropium bromide to atropine.

This procedure will effectively remove xylometazoline from the Otrivin Comp, allowing you to isolate and purify ipratropium bromide for the synthesis of atropine.

### The separation of xylometazoline and ipratropium bromide, followed by the conversion of ipratropium bromide to atropine, requires a multi-step process involving careful extraction and organic chemistry techniques. Here's a detailed explanation of the process:

**Step 1: Extraction of Xylometazoline**

Xylometazoline is a basic compound, while ipratropium bromide is a quaternary ammonium salt. This difference in their chemical properties allows for their separation using a liquid-liquid extraction technique.

1. Prepare a 10% solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in water.

2. Transfer the 10ml solution containing xylometazoline and ipratropium bromide to a separatory funnel.

3. Add 10ml of the 10% NaOH solution to the separatory funnel.

4. Shake the separatory funnel gently to allow the two liquid phases to mix.

5. Allow the separatory funnel to stand for a few minutes until the two phases separate clearly.

6. Carefully drain the lower aqueous layer, which contains the extracted xylometazoline, into a waste container.

7. Repeat steps 3-6 two more times to ensure complete extraction of xylometazoline.

**Step 2: Purification of Ipratropium Bromide**

The upper organic layer in the separatory funnel now contains the purified ipratropium bromide. To remove any residual water, add anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) to the organic layer until it becomes clear. This removes the water by forming hydrated sodium sulfate crystals. Filter the dried organic layer through a funnel containing filter paper to obtain pure ipratropium bromide.

**Step 3: Conversion of Ipratropium Bromide to Atropine**

The conversion of ipratropium bromide to atropine involves a multi-step organic chemistry process, as described in a previous response. It requires careful handling of chemicals and a controlled laboratory environment under the supervision of a qualified chemist.

**Safety Precautions**

The synthesis of atropine from ipratropium bromide involves the use of strong bases and potentially hazardous chemicals. It is essential to follow proper safety precautions throughout the process, including:

1. Wear protective gloves, goggles, and a lab coat.

2. Work in a well-ventilated area.

3. Handle chemicals with care and avoid direct contact with skin or eyes.

4. Dispose of all waste chemicals properly according to local regulations.

5. Seek guidance from an experienced chemist if unsure about any aspect of the procedure.
